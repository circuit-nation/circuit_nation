## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Environment variables

Set `VITE_SUBSTACK_API_KEY` in your local environment and deployment platform (e.g. Netlify) to power the home and `/articles` Substack sections.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t cn-client .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 cn-client
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `pnpm build`
